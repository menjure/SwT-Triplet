# A Method for Recognition of Cattle Noseprint based Fusing Swin Transformer and Triplet Network

## Introduction



## Installation

Simply clone this repository to your desired local directory: `git clone https://github.com/menjure/SwT-Triplet.git` and install any missing requirements. Requires python=3.8, pytorch=1.11.0, torchvision=0.12.0, scikit-learn=1.1.3, seaborn=0.12.1, pillow=9.1.1, tqdm=4.64.1, opencv-python=4.6.0.66

## Data preparation

Download the cattle noseprint dataset from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1K9o-KhLYBdJtu-H6Okbm2Q), password: `rj6y`. Unzip the file and put it in `datasets/Cattle_12/crop_nose_images/`.

## Train

Download the weights file from [here](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v1.0.0/swin_small_patch4_window7_224.pth) and put it in folder `weights/`. Then train with the following code:

```(python)
python train.py --model_path weights/swin_small_patch4_window7_224.pth --save_folder weights/
```

## Test

The weights generated by the training are saved in `weights/best_model_state.pth`. You can test with the following code:

```(python)
python test.py --model_path weights/best_model_state.pth
```

You can also download our best weights file from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/138cc9BxpF6e2E6qXFqImhg), password: `8435`. Then test with the following code:

```(python)
python test.py --model_path weights/best_acc_weights.pth
```
