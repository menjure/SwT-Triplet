SwT-Triplet: A Method for Recognition of Cattle Noseprint based fusing Swin Transformer and Triplet Network

## introduction
Amidst the rapid global development of agriculture and animal husbandry, the recognition of cattle has become a crucial issue in ranch management. Previous studies have commonly relied on extracting features such as cattle back patterns and body structures to identify individual cattle. However, not all cattle possess distinct body pattern features, making them unsuitable for certain breeds. To address this issue, this paper proposes the use of cattle noseprint as a distinguishing feature for individual cattle, as noseprint offer uniqueness and universality. Furthermore, this architecture fusing Swin Transformer and triplet network is proposed for noseprint classification, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.61% on a newly curated dataset of 432 images. These results align with the expected outcomes and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This method holds significant implications for cattle traceability, insurance claims, and financial loans.
